Translating M'lady Appraisal from Moon Runes to English!

First, install Python 3 for Windows. Incase you don't know, Python is a
programming language, and a special program is required to run scripts written
in Python.

How to use it?
1. Copy-paste the Appraisal text from the Japanese website into input.txt
   (See included example). Copy everything from the 『 to the 』
2. Only one Appraisal block can be translated at any time!
3. Make sure the text is saved using utf8 encoding!
   Use Sublime Text or Notepad++ if regular Notepad is giving you problems.
4. Execute 'translator.py'. This should be as easy as double-clicking it.
5. Check the output in 'output.txt'!
6. If the output is wrong or blank, check errors.txt

If you open the 'translator.py' file in Notepad, there are some configuration
options you can do, namely choosing to list skills/titles in multiple lines
instead of a single line.

Email me if you have questions or find any bugs! Please include errors.txt
when you are reporting a bug.
